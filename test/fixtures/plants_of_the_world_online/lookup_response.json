It has a few branching stems, along which overlapping pairs of flat, red-edged leaves are arranged. Older leaves turn brown and persist for a long time. From December-March, dense, flat-topped heads of red flowers are carried at the top of the stems. Each flower measures about 1 cm across.&nbsp; </p> \n<p> Pollination is by butterflies, particularly the mountain pride butterfly, <em> Meneris tulbaghia </em> , which is unusual among butterflies in pollinating bright red flowers. </p>  Uses  \n<p> Red crassula is cultivated as an ornamental.
