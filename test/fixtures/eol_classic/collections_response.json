{"name":"Beautiful Sea Monsters","description":"Many denizens of the world oceans could be described as monstrous- they may have: tentacles, a fearsome reputation, big teeth, an air of mystery, way more than the usual number of legs, an alien or unfamiliar appearance, and, in many cases, a distinct lack of what you might call a face. Yet these monsters frequently also possess: grace, brilliant colors, striking patterns, pleasing symmetry, sparkly or shiny surfaces, and charm.  This collection is for those beautiful monsters.","created":"2011-08-15T02:15:58.000Z","modified":"2019-06-28T21:39:37.000Z","total_items":20,"collection_items":[{"name":"acoel flatworms","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":3076,"title":"Acoela","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2019-06-14T15:31:53.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"spoon worms","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":8847,"title":"Echiura","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2019-06-14T15:31:29.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Globigerina d'Orbigny 1826","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":62240,"title":"Globigerina","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"loriciferans","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":1537,"title":"Loricifera","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Vestimentiferan tubeworms","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":393268,"title":"\u003ci\u003eLamellibrachia luymesi\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Giant tube worm","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":393274,"title":"\u003ci\u003eRiftia pachyptila\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"brown sea anemone","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":421495,"title":"\u003ci\u003eMetridium senile\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Limy tube worm","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":483746,"title":"\u003ci\u003eSerpula vermicularis\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Edible sea urchin","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":599659,"title":"\u003ci\u003eEchinus esculentus\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Jewel anemone","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":621960,"title":"\u003ci\u003eCorynactis viridis\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Strawberry anemones","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":1006944,"title":"\u003ci\u003eCorynactis californica\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Peacock Mantis Shrimp","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":2869734,"title":"\u003ci\u003eOdontodactylus scyllarus\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Swimming sea cucumber","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":3023405,"title":"\u003ci\u003eEnypniastes eximia\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"\u003ci\u003eOphiosteira antarctica\u003c/i\u003e Bell 1902","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":3047606,"title":"\u003ci\u003eOphiosteira antarctica\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-06T21:04:13.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Thaliacea","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":46585483,"title":"Thaliacea","created":"2018-12-19T17:49:19.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Pyrosome","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":46585531,"title":"Pyrosoma","created":"2018-12-19T17:57:53.000Z","updated":"2018-12-19T18:01:23.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Sea nettle","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":46554332,"title":"\u003ci\u003eChrysaora fuscescens\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-19T18:04:52.000Z","updated":"2019-05-22T21:48:57.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"\u003ci\u003eParamphithoe hystrix\u003c/i\u003e (Ross 1835)","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":46522596,"title":"\u003ci\u003eParamphithoe hystrix\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2018-12-19T18:46:43.000Z","updated":"2019-05-22T21:48:57.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Blue-Spotted Sea Urchin","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":2986712,"title":"\u003ci\u003eAstropyga radiata\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2019-04-02T21:30:23.000Z","updated":"2019-05-22T21:49:07.000Z","annotation":"","sort_field":""},{"name":"Christmas tree worm","object_type":"TaxonConcept","object_id":620727,"title":"\u003ci\u003eSpirobranchus giganteus\u003c/i\u003e","created":"2020-06-12T14:24:07.000Z","updated":"2020-06-12T14:24:07.000Z","annotation":null,"sort_field":null}]}
